## Sernarios 

### Scenario #1: Input Length
If the user's input is not two or three characters long, it is misinputted. The only exception is when "H" is inputted, and will be an exception for ALL the following scenarios. 
This expression handles the length not being 2 or 3 characters long, with the exception of "H":
```
move_input == "H" or (len(move_input) not in (2, 3)) 
```

### Scenario #2: First Two Characters
The first two characters must each be a digit. If any of them are not then we have to return `False` with the exception of "H".
```
move_input == "H" or not move_input[:2].isdigit() 
```

### Scenario #3: Out of Range Integers
If the first two characters are digits then each digit must be within the range of 0 and the board's size. We must check each of the first two characters individually, and because `board` directly represents the list of `Cell` objects, `len(board)` gives us the size. 
```
move_input == "H" or int(move_input[0]) not in range(len(board)) or int(move_input[1]) not in range(len(board))
```

### Putting Scenarios #1-3 Together
Because all of the scenarios above have the exception of "H", we can combine the non-"H" scenarios all in one clause:
```
if move_input == "H" or (len(move_input) not in (2, 3) or not move_input[:1].isdigit() or int(move_input[0]) not in range(len(board)) or int(move_input[1]) not in range(len(board))):
        return False
```

### Scenario #4: Flagging Code
When flagging, the first two characters have to be digits and the third character has to be `"f"` exactly. 
```
if len(move_input) == 3 and move_input[2] != "f":
    return False
```

### All Other Cases 
```
If the input 'passes' all of the given scenarios, then it must be valid input. You should return `True` if your code goes through all the scenarios without returning `False`.
```
