## Mine Positions

### Possible Mine Positions
There are two possible approaches:

* Generate a list of numbers (ex. if board is 5x5 then we would generate list of numbers from 0 to 24)
  * Then pick a random number and compute the row and col ID 
* Making the list of positions in tuple form directly and picking randomly from that list

For our hints, we will go with the first approach.

### Generating Possible Positions
We need to generate a list of numbers. Each number should correspond to a board position and every board position should be covered.

We are given the `size`, so we just square `(size - 1)` to find the greatest integer, and then use `range` to generate a list from 0 to that greatest integer. We need a list so we cast that expression to a `list` type. 
```
available_pos = list(range((size - 1) * (size - 1)))
```

### Picking and Assigning Mine Positions
To assign a mine, we pick a position randomly from the available positions. Then we should remove that position from the available positions so that duplicate positions do not get chosen.

To choose a random position, we can use the `random.choice` function. Don't forget to remove the position you just chose! We don't want duplicate mines.
```
new_pos = random.choice(available_pos)
available_pos.remove(new_pos)
```

### Getting Row and Col ID from a Position
For a 5x5 grid, the number positions would look like this:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td><b>Col 0</b></td>
        <td><b>Col 1</b></td>
        <td><b>Col 2</b></td>
        <td><b>Col 3</b></td>
        <td><b>Col 4</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 0</b></td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 1</b></td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>9</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 2</b></td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>13</td>
        <td>14</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 3</b></td>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>17</td>
        <td>18</td>
        <td>19</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Row 4</b></td>
        <td>20</td>
        <td>21</td>
        <td>22</td>
        <td>23</td>
        <td>24</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Given this table I can see that the element 11 corresponds to row 2, column 1. How can you compute the row and column for any element given its number? 

To calculate your row and column given an integer position, the row is simply the position divided by the size and the column is the remainder of that division. With that `row_id` and `col_id` calculated, you can directly place a mine using `Board`'s `place_mine` function.
```
(row_id, col_id) = (new_pos // size, new_pos % size)
board.place_mine(row_id, col_id)
```

## Entirety of `create_board`
### Do not forget to place the number of indicated mines!
```
def create_board(size, mines):
    board = Board(tuple([tuple([Cell(False) for i in range(size)]) for j in range(size)]))
    available_pos = list(range((size - 1) * (size - 1)))
    for i in range(mines):
        new_pos = random.choice(available_pos)
        available_pos.remove(new_pos)
        (row_id, col_id) = (new_pos // size, new_pos % size)
        board.place_mine(row_id, col_id)
    return board
```
