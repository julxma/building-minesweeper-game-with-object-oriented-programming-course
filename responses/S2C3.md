#### How to Use Setters
The `Cell` class will have **setters** for its attributes. We have three attributes `is_mine`, `is_visible` and `is_flagged`, all of which will change due to user input during the game. Therefore, we will have a setter corresponding to each attribute.

#### Setter Functionality
We recommend adding setters to your `Cell` class with the following variable names: 

- `show` (shows what is inside the cell by setting `is_visible` to true)
  - This setter will run when a user wants to show a tile
- `flag` (flags/unflags a cell by inverting `is_flagged`)
  - Flags can be removed!
- `place_mine` (places a mine in a cell by setting `is_mine` to true; **used only when creating the board**)
