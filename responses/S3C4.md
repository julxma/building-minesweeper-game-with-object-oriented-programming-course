### Helpers

#### Helper functions
Remember that `count_surrounding` should use `get_neighbors` AND `is_in_range`! Ideally you should have those defined already. 

##### Iteration
We can iterate directly on `self.get_neighbors`, there is no need to get the actual `Cell` object pertaining to the given `row_id` and `col_id`. 
```
sum = 0
for (surr_row, surr_col) in self.get_neighbors(row_id, col_id):
```

##### Check if valid neighbors are mines 
We call `is_in_range` to check each neighbor's validity and if the cell is a mine. 
```
    if (self.is_in_range(surr_row, surr_col) and self[surr_row][surr_col].is_mine): 
        sum += 1
return sum
```

#### Purpose of `count_surrounding`
Remember that `count_surrounding` returns the number of neighbors of a cell that have a mine. Calling `get_neighbors` will let you obtain a list of neighbors. You'll have to check whether they are valid neighbors with `is_in_range` and if the neighbor is valid, how many of them are mines. 

Solution:
```
def count_surrounding(self, row_id, col_id):
    sum = 0
	for (surr_row, surr_col) in self.get_neighbors(row_id, col_id):
        if (self.is_in_range(surr_row, surr_col) and self[surr_row][surr_col].is_mine): 
        sum += 1
	return sum
```

Compact solution for your reference (harder to read):
```
def count_surrounding(self, row_id, col_id):
    return sum(1 for (surr_row, surr_col) in self.get_neighbors(row_id, col_id) if (self.is_in_range(surr_row, surr_col) and self[surr_row][surr_col].is_mine))
