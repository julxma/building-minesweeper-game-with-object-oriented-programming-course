## Board Class Methods
Now that we have completed some helper functions, the Board class should contain the following methods that will help implement the rules of our Minesweeper game:

- A method is_solved that checks if the user has won the game.
    - should have the property() decorator - we will reference is_solved as a property of Cell later
- A method flag that flags/unflags a cell if it has not been selected yet by the user.
- A method mine_repr that defines what a cell should reveal, given a cell's row and column.
    - Should return the cell's value within the board depending on its state
    - "M" for mine, "F" for flagged, and "X" for non-visible cells
    - If a cell is visible and not a mine, then output a number indicating the number of adjacent mines to that cell
        - If number is 0, just output a space
- A method show() that handles showing a previously not visible cell. Hint: there are three different events that will hapen whenever a blank cell is selected. (show())
    - Please make sure to update the is_playing property to False when a mine is shown - that indicates a loss of the entire game.
    - If a cell is flagged we do not show it.
- A method __str__() that prints out the entire board.
    - This method should return a string that will be printed, not actually print to the console.
    - Components of the board include the following:
        - The number of mines left in the board
        - The board itself (by default, each cell is an "X")
        - The row numbers on both left and right side of the board
        - The column numbers on both top and bottom side of the board
