## Rows

### Printing out the Rows
For each subsequent row, the string representation of each cell should be printed.
* What helper function have we already defined that we can call here to find the value that should be printed for each cell depending on their state?
Make sure the row number is printed at the beginning and the end of each row for better visibility.

To output each row, we will have to iterate through `self`. However we also want to print the associated `row_id` with each row, and we can do that by using `enumerate(self)` to get a tuple of a count associated with the row. 
```
for (row_id, row) in enumerate(self):
```

We'll first print a newline and then the `row_id`, properly spaced. Make sure you are doing this at the end of each row as well.
```
"\n" + str(row_id) + " "
```

We want to iterate through all the columns to get each cell object individually. After finding an individual `Cell`, we can use `mine_repr` to print each cell. Then we can use the built-in `join` function to put all of the characters together in one string for each row. We use `enumerate(row)` to just get a `col_id`, we won't actually do anything with the contents of the row. 
```
     "".join(self.mine_repr(row_id, col_id) 
             for (col_id, _) in enumerate(row)) 
```

## Completed Code
You should prepend remaining mines and column headers to this string.
```
for (row_id, row) in enumerate(self):
    board_string += ("\n" + str(row_id) + " " +
                     "".join(self.mine_repr(row_id, col_id)
                             for (col_id, _) in enumerate(row)) + " " + str(row_id))
```
