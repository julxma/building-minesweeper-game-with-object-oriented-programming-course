## The Board Class

What other object(s) does the game has besides cells? **A board! **

Let's create a board that we can display for the game! We can do this by developing a Board class.

The **Board** class inherits from the tuple class. The class definition and constructor are provided for you here:

```
class Board(tuple):
    def __init__(self, tup):
        super().__init__()
        self.is_playing = True
```

Because we inherit from the tuple class, self will reference a tuple that will contain the list of cells. You can reference a specific Cell at (row_id, col_id) by using the code self[row_id][col_id].

We'll first implement some helper methods that are necessary for the main class functions:

- A method place_mine that places a mine at a cell.
- A method count_surrounding that returns the number of surrounding mines of a cell.
- A method get_neighbors that returns all neighbors of a cell
- A method is_in_range that returns if a cell's row and column are valid and in range
    - Our implentation uses is_in_range in conjunction with get_neighbors inside of count_surrounding
    - optional if you handle out of bound errors in is_in_range or get_neighbors
- A method remaining_mines that will return the number of remaining mines
    - equal to number of mines subtracted by number of flags used
    - will display for the user to know how many mines there areleft
    - should have the property() decorator

We recommend starting off with the helper functions then moving on to the main ones.
