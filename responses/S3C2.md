### Comment 2: The Surroundings (4-2)

#### What are the surrounding cells?
We want to find all 8 of the surrounding cells given a cell's row and column. We can define a tuple or list called `SURROUNDING` that stores the 8 sets of coordinates which define the relationship between the neighbors and a cell. 


#### A SURROUNDING list?
For example, the cell directly to the north is the cell in the same column but the previous row (-1), therefore the coordinates for the north direction are (-1, 0).

##### `SURROUNDING` Given
These tuples represent the surrounding cells in all 8 directions. 

Code: 
```
SURROUNDING = ((-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),
               (0, -1), (0, 1),
               (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1))
```

#### Using `SURROUNDING`

This expression will return a tuple of tuples that represent the 8 surrounding coordinates given `SURROUNDING`.

```
((row_id + surr_row, col_id + surr_col) for (surr_row, surr_col) in SURROUNDING)
```

#### Complete Code
```
def get_neighbours(self, row_id, col_id):    
    SURROUNDING = ((-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),                   (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1))    
    return ((row_id + surr_row, col_id + surr_col) for (surr_row, surr_col) in SURROUNDING)
```
