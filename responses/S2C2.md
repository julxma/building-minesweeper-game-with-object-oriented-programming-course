#### Setter Syntax

Each setter takes in a `self` as an argument. `self` refers to a specific instance of our class and under the hood, it ensures that we are calling the method on the correct instance of our class. 

Therefore, whenever we create methods inside our class, we must pass in `self`. 

Code: 
```
def setter_name(self):
    # insert your setter implementation here
```

#### show() Setter
We execute the `show()` setter whenever we want to make a tile **visible**, therefore all we have to do is set the `is_visible` instance variable of `self` to True. 
Note that we don't need a setter for the other way around - if a tile is visible it cannot become invisible!

Code: 
```
def show(self):    
    self.is_visible = True
```

#### place_mine() Setter
The `place_mine()` setter is run to indicate that this tile has a mine. We just have to set `self.is_mine` to `True`:

Code: 
```
def place_mine(self):
    self.is_mine = True
```
