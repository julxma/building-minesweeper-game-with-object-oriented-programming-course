### Using `input`

```
user_input = input('Enter a move')
```

### Initial Prompt
We use `input` in the following manner to initially prompt the user, and also handle the "H" case right away:
```
move = input("Enter your move (for help enter \"H\"): ")
if move == "H":
    move = input(INSTRUCTIONS)
```

### Check for validity
#### While input is not valid
We can use a *while loop* to continuously prompt the user if input is not valid. Additionally, we already have coded our `is_valid` function that we can directly use here! Note that we also handle the "H" case here, otherwise the user can input misvalid input and then input "H" without getting their instructions.
```
    while not is_valid(move, board):
        move = input("Invalid input. Enter your move (for help enter \"H\"): ")
        if move == "H":
            move = input(INSTRUCTIONS)
```

### Return Type
We need to return a three-element tuple consisting of the row number, col number and a boolean containing whether the move flags or not. Don't forget to type cast!
``` 
    return (int(move[1]), int(move[0]), move[-1] == "f")
```

### Complete `get_move` Solution
```
def get_move(board):
    INSTRUCTIONS = ("First, enter the column, followed by the row. To add or remove a flag, add \"f\" after the row (for example, 64f would place a flag on the 6th column, 4th row). Enter your move: ")

    move = input("Enter your move (for help enter \"H\"):")
    if move == "H":
        move = input(INSTRUCTIONS)

    while not is_valid(move, board):
        move = input("Invalid input. Enter your move (for help enter \"H\"): ")
        if move == "H":
            move = input(INSTRUCTIONS)

    return (int(move[1]), int(move[0]), move[-1] == "f")
```
