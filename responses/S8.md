## Congratz on Completing the Course!!!

We are finally done building our Minesweeper game! The final step is to call everything properly in our `main` function.
`main` should be composed of the following steps:

1. Create a board.
2. Board should be printed.
3. So long as the game is still in session and the board is not solved yet, the program should continuously prompt for a move.
4. Get the move from the user.
5. Show or flag the user-inputted cell, depending on the move.
6. Print the board again.
7. Repeat steps 3-7 so long as the conditions in Step 3 or not met.
8. When the conditions are met, output a congratulations message if the board is solved. Otherwise the user must have lost, so output a message indicating the user has failed.

There are **7 test cases** for you to test your program on covering a variety of scenarios.

### Necessary Functionalities
Inside of `main()`, you are **creating a board**, **getting a move**, **showing a cell**, **flagging a cell**. Think about what functions you have implemented up to this point to use in `main()`. You have completed all the implementations already! It all comes down to how you call your functions.

### Printing a Board
When you print an instance of a class, which function is automatically called?
