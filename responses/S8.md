Now that we have our board and can validate users' input, we should of course allow the user to finally play the game! We need to first know which cell does the user want to select.

The get_move function takes in a board object and returns a tuple that contains three elements:

1. A single-digit integer that represents the column that the user wants to select.
2. A single-digit integer that represents the row that the user wants to select.
3. Boolean indicating if the user wants to flag or not

We prompt the user to enter their selection with this blurb:

    Enter your move (for help enter "H"):

Please note that if they enter "H", instructions should be displayed, and the next move should be reassigned to whatever is their next input. Here are the instructions you should output:
```
INSTRUCTIONS = ("First, enter the column, followed by the row. To add or remove a flag, add \"f\" after the row (for example, 64f would place a flag on the 6th column, 4th row). Enter your move: ")
```

We also need to check if the user enters in correct input! Every time a user enters in an invalid input, we output an error message that can be the following.

    Invalid input. Enter your move (for help enter "H"):

The move would be reassigned to whatever their next input is.
