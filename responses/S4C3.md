### The Possibilities

There are four possibilities for us to account for:

* Visible but a mine -> "M"
* Flagged -> "F"
* Not visible -> "X"
* Visible but not a mine -> number indicating amount of adjacent mines

#### Handling those possibilities
To handle each of those possibilties, a simple if conditional with the corresponding `Cell` attributes should suffice to handle your "M", "F" and "X" cases.
If a cell is visible and not a mine, we should use our helper `count_surrounding` to calculate the number of surrounding mines. Make sure you handle the case when there are no surrounding mines!

##### Isolating the cell
We first can obtain the `Cell` object of interest with the following line:
```
cell = self[row_id][col_id]
```

##### Visible Cases
We have two cases for when a cell is visible: mine or non-mine. If a cell is a mine we return "M". 
```
if cell.is_visible:    
    if cell.is_mine:        
        return "M"    
```

If a cell is visible and not a mine, we find the number of neighbors with `self.count_surrounding`. Because `count_surrounding` returns a number, we need to convert it to a string. For the zero case, we return an empty space. 
```
    else:        
        surr = self.count_surrounding(row_id, col_id)
        return str(surr) if surr else " "
```

##### Other Cases
Continuing the conditional, if the cell is flagged we return "F". Now we have handled all the visible and flagged tiles, so every other tile must be not visible, which returns "X".
```
  elif cell.is_flagged:    
      return "F"
  else:    
      return "X"
```
  
#### Returning Values
Lastly, make sure you return only one character or number.

### Complete `mine_repr()` Solution
```
def mine_repr(self, row_id, col_id):
    cell = self[row_id][col_id]
    if cell.is_visible:
        if cell.is_mine:
            return "M"
        else:
            surr = self.count_surrounding(row_id, col_id)
            return str(surr) if surr else " "
    elif cell.is_flagged:
        return "F"
    else:
        return "X"
```
