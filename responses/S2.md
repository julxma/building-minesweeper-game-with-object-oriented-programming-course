## The First Most Important Part of the Game 

What is the Minesweeper board composed of? Squares or as we will call it in our program, cells!

Let's create a cell object that we can use for our Minesweeper board! We can do this by building a Cell class.

A cell can be visible, flagged, and/or has a mine in it.

- A visible cell means that it has been selected by the user.
- A flagged cell means that it has been flagged by the user.
- A cell can also have a mine in it.

Each of those attributes of the cell has its own setters:

- A method that shows what is inside the cell by making the cell visible.
- A method that flags the cell.
- A method that places a mine in the cell.

#### Naming your Instance Variables
We recommend adding instance variables to your class with the following variable names: 

- `is_mine`  (indicates that the cell is a mine)
- `is_visible`  (indicates that the cell has been selected by the user and is visible; by default, this attribute is **false**)  
- `is_flagged`  (indicates that the cell has been flagged by the user; by default, this attribute is **false**)

#### Coding the Constructor
First we will build our contructor to initialize attributes in the `Cell` class. Attributes of the cell class is mentioned above.

```
def __init__(self, is_mine, is_visible=False, is_flagged=False):
        self.is_mine = is_mine
        self.is_visible = is_visible
        self.is_flagged = is_flagged
```
