### Winning
When has the player won a game of Minesweeper? When the player has *made all non-mine cells visible* and all the *mine cells are not visible*. 

#### What does this mean?
Therefore, in our code, whenever every cell is visible or a mine, then that means our game is "solved" and we should return `True` in that scenario. Don't forget the `@property` decorator!

##### Set-Up
We need to designate `is_solved(self)` with a `@property` decorator:
```
@property
def is_solved(self):
    solved = True
```

We set up iteration through each cell:
```
for row in self:
    	for cell in row:     
```
We have to make sure to handle visibility and mines. If there exists one cell that is not visible and is not a mine, then the game has not been solved.
```
if (cell.is_visible or cell.is_mine):
            continue
        else:
            solved = False      
	return solved
```

Complete Solution:
```
@property
def is_solved(self):
    solved = True
    for row in self:
    	for cell in row:  
            if (cell.is_visible or cell.is_mine):
            	continue
       		else:
            	solved = False      
	return solved
```

Compact Solution for your reference (using the `all` word):
```
@property
def is_solved(self):
    return all((cell.is_visible or cell.is_mine) for row in self for cell in row)	
```
