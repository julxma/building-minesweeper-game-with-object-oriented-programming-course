## The Neighbors
How do we check if there are zero surrounding mines? We can use our helper `count_surrounding` to check if there are zero adjacent mines.
```
# note that this continues from the previous code
elif self.count_surrounding(row_id, col_id) == 0:
```

### What to do?
If there are no surrounding mines then we want to show all of this tile's neighbors. Use `get_neighbors` to obtain all the neighbors of this tile. 
We can iterate through all possible neighbors using `self.get_neighbors`:
```
	for (surr_row, surr_col) in self.get_neighbors(row_id, col_id):
```

### Out of bounds Handling
Depending on how you implemented `get_neighbors` previously, you may have to run `is_in_range` on each neighbor to ensure all your neighbors actually exist within the grid. 
Checking if a neighbor is in range before showing:
```
    if self.is_in_range(surr_row, surr_col):       	
```      
    
### Handling Each Valid Neighbor
Now for each valid neighbor, we want to show it on the board, so we just recursively run the `show()` function on each neighbor. Given that we want to show the cell with the surrounding coordinates in the board, which `show()` should you use: `Cell` or `Board`?
```
      self.show(surr_row, surr_col)
```

## Complete Solution (excluding code covered in other hints for the other visibility cases)
```
    # code continues...        
    elif self.count_surrounding(row_id, col_id) == 0:
        for (surr_row, surr_col) in self.get_neighbours(row_id, col_id):
            if self.is_in_range(surr_row, surr_col):
                self.show(surr_row, surr_col)
```
