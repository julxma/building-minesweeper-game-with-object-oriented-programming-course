### More On Cells!

#### show(): Obtaining the specific cell at (row_id, col_id)
First, we have to locate the cell at `(row_id, col_id)`. How do we do that? `Cell` object of interest can be obtained with the following line:
```
cell = self[row_id][col_id]
```

#### Only showing non-visible and non-flagged cells
If a cell is visible or flagged, then we shouldn't show it. If it is not visible and not flagged then we should show it using the `Cell` class's `show()` function. 
We can show the cell by running the `show()` setter from `Cell`:
```
if not (cell.is_visible or cell.is_flagged):
    cell.show()
```

#### Updating `is_playing`
After the previous check, if the player shows a mine, then the game is over, so `self.is_playing` must be set to `False` in that case.
```
if cell.is_mine:    
        self.is_playing = False
```
We set `is_playing` to `False`. The case for handling tiles without surrounding mines is handled in another hint.

### Complete Colution (w/o no adjacent mine handling)
```
def show(self, row_id, col_id):
    cell = self[row_id][col_id]
    if not (cell.is_visible or cell.is_flagged):
        cell.show()

        if cell.is_mine:
            self.is_playing = False
        elif # insert condition here
        	# insert rest of code here
 ```
