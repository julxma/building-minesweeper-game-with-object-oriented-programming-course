## The Actual Board

Now that we have our two classes, Board and Cell, let's actually utilize the two classes to create our Minesweeper board!

The create_board function takes in integers size (how big the board should be) and mines (the list of numbers of mines we want in our board) and returns a board object.

Within create_board, the board will be initialized like so:
```
board = Board(tuple([tuple([Cell(False) for i in range(size)]) for j in range(size)]))
```

Before returning board, we want to first put in the mines in randomized cells! For each mine, randomly choose a cell in the board and place the mine in that chosen position.
