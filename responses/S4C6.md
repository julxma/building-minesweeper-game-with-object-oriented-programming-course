## The Displays

### Displaying Remaining Mines
There is an attribute we have already defined that allows us to easily compute the number of mines left on the board.
We can use `self.remaining_mines` to compute the number of remaining mines on the board. Remember `remaining_mines` has a `@property` decorator so we can use it as a property of our `Board` object! Remember we are returning one string so we add a new line at the end for the sake of clean output.
```
"Mines: " + str(self.remaining_mines) + "\n  " +
```

### Printing out the Columns
Next, in the first row, we should print each column number, those will serve as our column headers and let the player more easily tell what column each cell is in.
Make sure the column number is printed at the beginning and the end of each column for better visibility.

`len(self[0])` will give us the number of columns. We simply iterate through the list of 0, 1, ..., `len(self[0])` and print the string version of each number to print out the columns. Make sure to do this at the end as well. 
```
"".join([str(i) for i in range(len(self[0]))])
```
## Combined Code
You should append row headers and row content to this string.
```
board_string = ("Mines: " + str(self.remaining_mines) + "\n  " +                "".join([str(i) for i in range(len(self[0]))]))
```
