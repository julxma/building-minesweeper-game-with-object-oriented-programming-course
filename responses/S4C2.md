### Tracking Cells

#### Obtain the cell with given row and col
Because we are changing the `is_flagged` property of one cell, we need to obtain that one `Cell` object to act on. How could we do that?

##### Isolating the cell
We first can obtain the `Cell` object of interest with the following line:
```
cell = self[row_id][col_id]
```

##### Handle Visibility
If the cell is not visible and we have more miens to flag, we flag it by calling the `Cell` class's `flag` setter. Otherwise we print a message to the console:
```
    if not cell.is_visible and self.remaining_mines > 0:
        cell.flag()
    elif self.remaining_mines == 0:
        if cell.is_visible:
            print("You have already flagged all your mines.")
        else:
            cell.flag()    
    else:
        print("Cannot add flag, cell already visible.")
```

Complete flag() solution:
```
def flag(self, row_id, col_id):
    cell = self[row_id][col_id]
    if not cell.is_visible:
        cell.flag()
    else:
        print("Cannot add flag, cell already visible.")
```
