#### Constructor code explained: 
Remember we use `__init__` to define constructors in Python. By default, `is_visible` and `is_flagged` is `False`, since our cells are all initialized at the start of the game. 

#### How to Use Instance Variables
In the constructor of our `Cell` class, we will store whether the cell is visible, flagged or is a mine. Therefore we have to add all those properties as **instance variables**.
