### Creating your Board
Create your board using `create_board`. Note that if we call `print` directly, the `__str__` method of `Board` automatically gets called!
```
SIZE = 7
MINES = 9
board = create_board(SIZE, MINES)
print(board)
```

### While Checking for Conditions
We know the game is still in session if `board.is_playing` is `True`. We also know the game is solved if `board.is_solved` is `False`, so those are our two conditions to continuously check for. From there we can assign multiple variables returned from `get_move` to get our IDs and `is_flag`.
```
while board.is_playing and not board.is_solved:
    (row_id, col_id, is_flag) = get_move(board)
```

### Determining Whether to Show or Flag
`is_flag` determines whether the move is a flag. If `is_flag` is `False`, then the only other possible move the user can do is `show` a cell. 
```
    if not is_flag:
        board.show(row_id, col_id)
    else:
        board.flag(row_id, col_id)
    print(board)
```

### Handling End Results
If the board is solved, print a congraulatory message. Otherwise the user had to show a mine, indicating a loss.
```
    if board.is_solved:
        print("Well done! You solved the board!")
    else:
        print("Uh oh! You blew up!")
```
