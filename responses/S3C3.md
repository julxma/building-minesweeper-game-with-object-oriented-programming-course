### The Cells 

#### Finding the cell given `self` (4-3)
Remember `self` represents the tuple of cells themselves in a 2D array. Therefore you can iterate through each row using `for row in self:` directly.

##### Iterating through Individual Cells
We first iterate through all the cells so that we can act on each `cell`. `remaining` will be returned at the end. 

```
remaining = 0
for row in self:
	for cell in row:
```

#### Using the Cell
After finding the `row` and then iterating through the row to find each cell, you can check if a cell is a mine or if a cell is flagged using `cell.is_mine` and `cell.is_flagged`. What should you do if a cell is a mine versus if a cell is flagged? 

##### Incrementing and Decrementing
If the cell is a mine then we want to increase the number of mines by 1. However if it is currently flagged then the user has determined it is a mine, so we should decrease our count by 1. 
```
    if cell.is_mine:
                remaining += 1
            if cell.is_flagged:
                remaining -= 1
```

#### Return remaining mines
Make sure you return the number of remaining mines (# of mines - # of flags used) when done. 

#### Completed Code
```
@property
def remaining_mines(self):
    remaining = 0
    for row in self:
        for cell in row:
            if cell.is_mine:
                remaining += 1
            if cell.is_flagged:
                remaining -= 1
    return remaining
```
